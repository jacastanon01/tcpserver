# TCP Server in Go

This application will demonstrate how to set up a TCP connection using Go. 

## What is TCP?

Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is built on top of the Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP) and establishes a connection between two computers. A request is sent from the client to the server and the response is sent back. A TCP connection guarantees delivery because data packets are transmitted in segments, and the protocol ensures that packets are received in the correct order. If any packet is lost or out of order, TCP handles retransmission, maintaining reliable data transfer. This connection is handled through a three-step "handshake" process: SYN, SYN-ACK, and ACK, which synchronizes both ends. Once the connection is established, data is transmitted in segments, and TCP ensures that all segments arrive intact and in order.

```go
// Instead of using log, I am opting for more granular logging by using depedency injection. This pattern also allows us to create new universal methods attached to our application. Totally unnecessary for this demo, but it's a habit I'd like to establish with Go projects
type application struct {
	logger *slog.Logger
}

func (app *application) connect(conn net.Conn) {
     // we will break things down into packets for the connection to read
	var buffer []byte = make([]byte, 1024)
	// Now that the connection is established, we can read the request
	_, err := conn.Read(buffer)
	if err != nil {
		app.logger.Error(err.Error())
	}

	app.logger.Info("Processing the request")
	time.Sleep(5 * time.Second)
	// Since we will test this with cURL, the response should be formatted as an HTTP response
	res := "HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n\r\nHello, World!\r\n"

	conn.Write([]byte(res))
	// After sending the response, we can close the TCP connection
	conn.Close()
}

func main() {
	logger := slog.New(slog.NewTextHandler(os.Stdout, nil))
	app := &application{
		logger: logger,
	}
	// First we establish the connection with our local server and listen to a specified port on the server
	listener, err := net.Listen("tcp", ":8080")
	if err != nil {
		app.logger.Error(err.Error())
	}
	// This is an infinite loop to keep the connection alive
	for {
		logger.Info("Waiting for client to connect")
		// This is awaiting the connection and establishing a client. This is a blocking call, so the server will not proceed until this receives data
		conn, err := listener.Accept()
		if err != nil {
			logger.Error(err.Error())
		}
		app.logger.Info("Client connected!")
		// Process the request and configure response
		// by using the go keyword we are attaching that connection to a thread, allowing our server to handle multiple requests
            // This also decouples each TCP connection to handle its own read, write processes
		go app.connect(conn)
	}
}
```

Currently, there are optimization issues if multiple clients try to open a thread at once, but this is a general overview of how computers communicate over the internet using TCP.

## Thread pools

A thread is a group of worker threads that are used to execute tasks concurrently. Whenever we want a thread, we pick from the pool and delegate a task to it. Once the task is completed, we add the thread back to the thread pool. This pattern allows us to handle multiple concurrent requests without overwhelming the hardware by distributing tasks evenly and capping the size of threads in our thread pool.

### Why Thread Pools with Go?

> By default, using `go` statements for every connection can create an unbounded number of goroutines, which might cause memory issues under heavy load. A goroutine pool (similar to a thread pool) limits the number of active goroutines, ensuring your system handles concurrency within its limits.
> Technically, Go does not use operating system (OS) threads directly in the same way traditional languages do; instead, Go has concurrency built into the language, offering developers flexibility in handling multiple tasks. While goroutines are not 1:1 mapped to OS threads, the Go runtime employs a more efficient model. When a goroutine is created, the Go runtime dynamically assigns it to an OS thread and manages the execution of thousands or even millions of goroutines without exhausting system resources.
> Because this scheduling happens at runtime, Go efficiently selects which OS threads to use for which goroutine. This allows Go to handle multiple tasks concurrently, even in the presence of blocking operations (such as I/O). The Go runtime scheduler ensures that blocking operations do not block an OS thread; instead, it can schedule another goroutine to run on that thread, maximizing concurrency and performance.
